##### Week 1. (Sept 17 - 23)
Started learning the unreal engine interface from a tutorial. Learned that my computer isn't very good at running it in full texture plus rendered lighting but because the game is top-down and 2D, it _should_ be fine. Did a couple of tests and played around with the terrain generator to see how it runs when launched. It isn't bad but again, the final product will be top-down anyways so I guess it doesn't really matter. Started assigning jobs in the group. Mine will be art direction and sprite animations because of my potato PC. **End log**
