##### Week 1. (Sept 17 - 23)
Started learning the unreal engine interface from a tutorial. Learned that my computer isn't very good at running it in full texture plus rendered lighting but because the game is top-down and 2D, it _should_ be fine. Did a couple of tests and played around with the terrain generator to see how it runs when launched. It isn't bad but again, the final product will be top-down anyways so I guess it doesn't really matter. Started assigning jobs in the group. Mine will be art direction and sprite animations because of my potato PC. **End log**


##### Week 2. (Sept 24 - Oct 1)
I discussed the roles of each person with the group and together, determined that my job is definitely to make sprites. I made the basic still shots of the character and that didn't seem like too much work. The animation though, is something that takes a long time. Good thing there won't be too many different enemies or player models to animate for. For an isometric game, the angles are pretty hard to get right for the models since I'm using pixels for sprites. I also helped to develop the story behind the character, the direction of the story in-game, and how the power-up system will work. To top it all off, I'm currently thinking about the artstyle of the game and how simple or complex it should be. Probably simpler so it can get done in a reasonable amount of time. **End log**
