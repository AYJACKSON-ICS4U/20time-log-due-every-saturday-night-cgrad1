ICS4U starter page

##### Week 1. (Sept 17 - 23)
Started learning the unreal engine interface from a tutorial. Learned that my computer isn't very good at running it in full texture plus rendered lighting but because the game is top-down and 2D, it _should_ be fine. Did a couple of tests and played around with the terrain generator to see how it runs when launched. It isn't bad but again, the final product will be top-down anyways so I guess it doesn't really matter. Started assigning jobs in the group. Mine will be art direction and sprite animations because of my potato PC. **End log**


##### Week 2. (Sept 24 - Oct 1)
I discussed the roles of each person with the group and together, determined that my job is definitely to make sprites. I made the basic still shots of the character and that didn't seem like too much work. The animation though, is something that takes a long time. Good thing there won't be too many different enemies or player models to animate for. For an isometric game, the angles are pretty hard to get right for the models since I'm using pixels for sprites. I also helped to develop the story behind the character, the direction of the story in-game, and how the power-up system will work. To top it all off, I'm currently thinking about the artstyle of the game and how simple or complex it should be. Probably simpler so it can get done in a reasonable amount of time. **End log**



##### Week 3. (Oct 2 - Oct 8)
I started making some sprites and a lot of them came out pretty well. The theme of the game is definitely pretty dark so it\s easy to make simple designs. The character model is being worked on and some ideas are bouncing around my head. Animating is proving to be quite lengthy but not exactly difficult. I'm glad my job is the easiest but then again, it's the most important and time-consuming, I think. **End log**


##### Week 4. (Oct 9 - Oct 15)
I completed the animations for an enemy and the character design was tweaked a little bit. A lot of things were considered about the story and how the art direction will continue. Apparently, I'll be designing the rooms as well, but now the generator that will construct the objects in them. Fair enough, I guess. I assigned the task of monotonously changing the colours for each version of the character to Tim so that I can focus on the more creative element, since I'm the only person creating the enemy sprites and such. The items and powerups have been clearly written out in the Outcast Wiki on Github so I'll have new ideas to think about. **End log**



##### Week 5. (Oct 16 - 22)
This week was probalby the most productive the group has ever been. Tim started working on the webpage and Anees started working on the music which works pretty well for the setting. We're still not sure about what Cooper's doing but we'll figure that out eventually. I was able to make several sprites for items, projectiles and the entire health HUD. The art is progressing at a pretty constant pace, I think. By the end of the month, I'll probably have all the projectiles and items done. I'll probalby start working on it more, though, since the people coding the game need something to look at, first. **End log**
